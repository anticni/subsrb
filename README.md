# SubSrb
## Serbian text replacer
LG TV's do not support Windows-1250 encoding in subtitles, hence they show you a block(&block;) or something even uglier.

This is a tool which replaces all the Serbian characters with their similar looking Latin counterparts, and it does all that *in-place*.

Just load a subtitle, let the script do its job, and you're done.
